# Jimbo - AI Personal Trainer

Jimbo is a comprehensive, AI-powered personal trainer web application. It combines the power of Google's Gemini AI for generating personalized workout/nutrition plans and the TensorFlow MoveNet model for real-time video form analysis.

## Features

- **AI Workout Generator**: Creates customized weekly workout plans based on user goals, experience, and available equipment.
- **AI Nutrition Generator**: Provides high-level nutrition plans with calorie/macro targets and meal examples.
- **AI Form Analysis**: Users can upload a video of an exercise and receive a detailed score (Spine, Stability, Joint, Control) and corrective feedback from an AI coach. Uses TensorFlow MoveNet (Thunder) for high-accuracy pose estimation and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compare user form against a "golden standard" from a database.
- **AI Coach Evaluation**: Analyzes a user's saved plan and check-in logs to provide motivational feedback and recommendations.
- **Dual Login & Save System**:
  - **Google Account Mode**: Securely logs in with a Google account and uses the Google Drive & Sheets API to save/load workout plans and progress logs.
  - **Tester Mode**: Allows for full app functionality without a Google account by saving/loading plan data and check-ins to a local .xlsx (Excel) file.
- **Progress Logger**: Log check-ins with date, weight, and notes.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a modern, user-friendly experience.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python**: Core language.
- **Flask**: Web server and API framework.
- **Google Gemini API**: For all text/JSON-based AI generation (workout plans, nutrition, evaluations, form feedback).
- **TensorFlow & TensorFlow-Hub**: For running the MoveNet model.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing.
- **DTW-Python**: For time-series form comparison.
- **SQLite**: For storing "golden standard" exercise data in `correct_movement.db`.
- **python-dotenv**: For environment variable management.
- **Flask-CORS**: For handling cross-origin requests.

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom-styled, responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side logic.
- **Google Identity Services**: For OAuth 2.0 login.
- **SheetJS**: For client-side Excel file creation/parsing in Tester Mode.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Google Gemini API key (obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))
- A Google OAuth Client ID (obtain from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/))
- The `correct_movement.db` SQLite database file (contains golden standard exercise data; not included in the repository)

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

### 1. Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd [your-repo-folder]
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create .env File**:
   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your API keys. You must get your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` from the Google Cloud Console (for OAuth) and a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from Google AI Studio (for Gemini).
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_oauth_client_id_here.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   ```
   Note: In `app.py`, the code will also check for `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a fallback for the Gemini API.

5. **Set Up the Database**:
   The form analysis feature requires a SQLite database named `correct_movement.db` containing the "golden standard" exercise data. This file is not included in the repository. You must have this database file in the same directory as `app.py` for the `/exercises` and `/analyze-form` endpoints to work.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. **Configure Google Client ID**:
   Go to the Google Cloud Console. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (the same one you put in `.env`).
   - Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **No Other Setup Needed!**
   All frontend dependencies (SheetJS) are loaded via a CDN in `index.html`.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   Run the `app.py` file from your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is activated).
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   You should see output indicating the Flask server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Open the Frontend**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
   The `app.py` server is configured to serve the `index.html` file automatically from the root URL.

## Deployment

The project ships with a lightweight multi-stage `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yaml` to streamline deployment. Before building images, make sure you have:

- A `.env` file in the project root that contains at least `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (or `GEMINI_API_KEY`) and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.
- The `correct_movement.db` SQLite database stored alongside the project (Docker Compose mounts it automatically).

### Option A: Docker (single container)

1. **Build the image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t jimbo-app:latest .
   ```
   This uses the multi-stage build to install dependencies and package the application.

2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run --name jimbo_app \
     -p 5000:5000 \
     --env-file .env \
     -v ${PWD}/correct_movement.db:/app/correct_movement.db \
     jimbo-app:latest
   ```
   - The `--env-file` flag injects the required API keys.
   - The volume mount makes the exercise database available inside the container.

3. **Access the app**
   Visit `http://localhost:5000` to use the UI.

### Option B: Docker Compose (recommended for local dev)

1. **Update `.env` and `correct_movement.db`**  
   Ensure both files exist in the repository root.

2. **Start the stack**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   - Builds the image (if needed) and starts the `web` service defined in `docker-compose.yaml`.
   - Automatically maps port `5000`, injects environment variables, and mounts the database.

3. **Verify logs & health**
   - Compose streams logs to your terminal. Wait for `Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000`.
   - If you change code, re-run with `docker compose up --build` to rebuild layers.

4. **Stop the stack**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Missing database**: The `/exercises` and `/analyze-form` endpoints require `correct_movement.db`. Confirm the file exists locally and is mounted into the container.
- **API keys**: If you see `GOOGLE_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set`, double-check your `.env`.
- **GPU / TensorFlow**: The provided image targets CPU. For GPU acceleration, base the image on an appropriate CUDA-enabled Python image and install GPU-enabled TensorFlow.
